All raw archives and their original Gitblobs are included/indexed by the publication manifest. Separate recipes retain their own source commits, plans, run IDs, hashes and failed attempts. Early status notes and technical retries are not scientific replications. The original test264compositions stays excluded in new studies. Publication in main does not convert an internal check into external replication.

## Final engineering update — 9 October 2026

The recovered RENDER10 cohort is complete:245 registered rows,77 output gates,143 original rows preserved exactly and0 repeated timing keys. OpenGL4.6 compute measures2.084x forC16/grid128 relative to the bestCUDA comparator and loses forC48/grid128; interruption separates sessions and qualifies interpretation. Live physical viewer integration passed27 trajectory gates plus52 HTTP checks; CPU/Mesa passed the same separate internal endpoint. RENDER11 retained100/105 original energy blocks after RAM8 stopped it; no complete comparative energy or wall-energy claim follows. See RENDER10_results.md, VIS07_viewer.md and RENDER11_results.md.
